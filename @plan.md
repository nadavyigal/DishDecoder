# DishDecoder Dietary Preferences Implementation Plan

## Overview
Add functionality to allow users to customize recipes according to dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free), providing alternative ingredients and recipe adaptation logic within backend services.

## Implementation Tasks

### Backend
- âœ… [CMP-v1.0] Created `dietaryPreferences.json` with comprehensive dietary types and substitution data
  - Added support for vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free, keto, and paleo diets
  - Included excluded ingredients and substitution mappings for each diet type
  
- âœ… [CMP-v1.0] Created `recipeAdapter.js` utility for recipe adaptation
  - Implemented logic to check for excluded ingredients
  - Added substitution selection functionality
  - Created functionality to adapt recipe steps based on ingredient substitutions
  - Added comprehensive error handling and logging
  
- âœ… [CMP-v1.0] Added new API endpoints to server
  - GET `/api/dietary-preferences` to retrieve available dietary types
  - Updated GET `/api/recipes/:id` to accept optional `dietaryType` query parameter
  - Added POST `/api/recipes/:id/adapt` for adapting recipes to specific dietary needs

- âœ… [CMP-v3.0] Replaced Clarifai with OpenAI Vision API for food recognition
  - Updated backend dependencies to use OpenAI SDK
  - Replaced environment variables to use OPENAI_API_KEY
  - Modified image recognition logic in server/index.js
  - Updated mock tests to match OpenAI's response format
  
### Frontend
- âœ… [CMP-v1.0] Updated TypeScript types to support dietary preferences
  - Added properties to Recipe, Ingredient, and Step interfaces
  - Created new DietaryType and DietaryPreferences interfaces
  
- âœ… [CMP-v1.0] Updated API service with dietary preference functionality
  - Updated getRecipe to accept dietaryType parameter
  - Added adaptRecipe method
  - Added getDietaryPreferences method
  
- âœ… [CMP-v1.0] Created UI components for dietary preferences
  - DietaryPreferences component for selection
  - RecipeAdaptationNotes component to display adaptation information
  - Updated RecipeDisplay to highlight substituted ingredients and modified steps

### Mobile Frontend
- âœ… [CMP-v2.0] Created theme system with warm, engaging color palette
  - Implemented amber, sage, and cream color scheme
  - Created typography and spacing systems
  - Set up consistent styling across the app

- âœ… [CMP-v2.0] Built reusable UI components
  - Created Button, Card, and RecipeCard components
  - Implemented responsive design for different screen sizes
  - Added animation-ready structure for transitions

- âœ… [CMP-v2.0] Developed core screens with intuitive navigation
  - Home screen with recipe grid and search
  - Camera screen for dish identification
  - Detailed recipe view with step-by-step instructions
  - Profile and Favorites screens for user management
  
- âœ… [CMP-v2.0] Implemented cross-platform compatibility
  - Ensured UI renders correctly on iOS and Android
  - Used platform-specific adaptations where needed
  - Optimized image handling for mobile devices
  
- âœ… [CMP-v2.0] Set up navigation system
  - Implemented bottom tab navigation
  - Created stack navigation for screen flows
  - Added animated transitions between screens
  
## Future Enhancements
- ðŸ’¡ Add functionality to save dietary preferences for users
- ðŸ’¡ Implement more detailed nutritional information for adapted recipes
- ðŸ’¡ Add ability for users to customize individual ingredient substitutions
- ðŸ’¡ Create a "similar recipes" suggestion feature based on dietary preferences
- ðŸ’¡ Add offline capabilities to mobile app with local storage
- ðŸ’¡ Implement social sharing features for recipes
- ðŸ’¡ Add push notifications for recipe recommendations

## Technical Considerations
- The current implementation uses in-memory adaptation, but could be extended to use a database
- The substitution logic could be enhanced with more complex analysis of recipe context
- Nutritional information would need to be adjusted based on substitutions
- Mobile app performance could be further optimized with lazy loading and image caching
- OpenAI Vision API provides more accurate and versatile food recognition compared to Clarifai

## Conclusion
The implementation successfully addresses the requirement to allow users to customize recipes according to dietary preferences. The system now provides alternative ingredients and recipe adaptation logic within backend services with a clean, intuitive UI for users to make these customizations on both web and mobile platforms. The mobile frontend delivers a consistent, engaging experience with a warm color palette and intuitive navigation with minimalistic text usage. The recent switch from Clarifai to OpenAI's Vision API improves food recognition accuracy and provides a more robust solution for identifying dishes from images.
